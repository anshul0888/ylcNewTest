With special pedestal access you’ll literally get beneath the skirt of Lady Liberty, learning about strange happenings in New York harbor; the ambivalent feelings that her French creator had towards America; the disdain that many Americans originally had for the statue herself; and an untold number of dead seagulls. With Ellis Island tickets included in the price, this is the perfect tour for people who want to learn everything they didn’t teach you in school about Lady Liberty. <br><br>Description<br><br>This is New York’s funniest and most insightful tour to the Statue of Liberty, giving you to the stories, rumors, legends that you won’t hear anywhere else. Want to know about the other tragedy on the day of JFK’s assassination (the one that involved a giant octopus)? Or what our guides ‘affectionately’ call Lady Liberty behind her back? Then this is your tour. <br><br>You’ll meet at Battery Park, home to a beer garden/immigration station, as well as a graphic plaque given to the city of New York by the Dutch to remind us that they stole Manhattan first. With a small group of 25 people or fewer and an expert local guide (carefully vetted for his/her sense of fun) you’ll board the ferry to Liberty Island. <br><br>During the crossing they will regale you with some of the more outlandish stories of Lower Manhattan. First and foremost is the tale of a ferry sinking that killed 400. In the wreckage authorities found the markings of what looked like huge suction cups on the side of the boat, pointing to an unlikely culprit. Is this the twisted story NY’s port authorities are hiding from you or is it a complete fabrication? The photographic evidence held by your guide is pretty convincing... <br><br>When you reach Liberty Island you’ll have special access to climb up to the Statue pedestal, via a stairway (or elevator) inside the structure. Climb under the skirts of Lady Liberty to marvel at her cavernous interior and hear the story of how she was made. Naturally, this won’t be the polite version from the history books. Instead you’ll learn how here creator was a little dramatic and didn’t always love Americans; how many Americans cared even less for his statue and weren’t interested in paying for the pedestal that you’re standing on (which eventually cost more than the statue itself); how her torch started out as little more than a flicker of light; and how many birds lost their lives because of it. You’ll also learn how the statue went from being little known and less cared for, to an icon of the American people, used to advertise everything from immigration and patriotism, to laxatives and cocaine. <br><br>After enjoying this eye-opening, hilarious, and eventually inspirational story, you’ll step outside for views from the pedestal that reach over the harbour and encompass much of Lower Manhattan - the perfect selfie spot. <br><br>Your guided tour ends here but your day doesn’t have to. With all-inclusive tickets valid for the rest of the day, you can take the ferry on to Ellis Island to explore the lovely museum by yourself and get even more information about the history of this hallowed stretch of harbor. The museum here is so well-curated, with videos, audio and huge photographic exhibits; you won’t need your guide at all. <br><br>Sites Visited: <br><br>Statue of Liberty<br>Battery Park<br>Ellis Island (unguided) <br><br>Important Notes: <br><br>Gratuities to guides are appreciated but never obligatory. <br>Please note that the tour meeting time is 15 minutes prior to the start time.

Created in collaboration with Disney Theatrical Group, this tour takes you behind the magic at the New Amsterdam Theatre; entering when the theatre is closed for a special guided tour. <br><br>Description: <br><br>Spend a full hour with the in-house historian, learning about the history of this incredible building. You’ll have the place to yourself so you can visit the first floor and balcony levels, admiring the vast stage as your guide describes what goes into the creation and performance of a Broadway production like ‘Beauty & The Beast’, ‘Mary Poppins’, ‘Aladdin’ and ‘The Lion King’. You’ll hear stories of the goings-on behind the scenes and learn about the superstitions held by Broadway performers — including a few ghost stories. <br><br>The highlight of your experience is in the second part of your New Amsterdam tour. You’ll visit the Prop Studio, where you’ll find treasures untold, getting up close and personal with original props, costumes and set piece for many of your favorite Disney on Broadway musicals. <br><br>While we do spend a lot of time on the Disney element of our tour (you’ll hear audio recordings from shows and learn lots of fun Disney trivia), we don’t just stop there: This is a proper Broadway tour. <br><br>To ensure that you get a full picture of Broadway and that you have as much context as possible when you visit the New Amsterdam, you’ll take a guided tour of Broadway before your visit, stopping at landmark theatres where legendary shows drew huge crowds and global attention. For this section of your tour, you’ll travel with one of our Broadway Insiders, a team drawn from a bank of actors, crew members and even theatre managers — all of whom have first-hand experience of life behind the curtain. <br><br>Discover the unlikely origins of Times Square and hear the rags-to-riches tale of NYC’s theatre district (and how Disney was instrumental in changing the fate of a notorious red light district). Learn of the legendary Ziegfeld Follies which kick started Broadway production as we know it, not to mention the careers of so many legendary performers. You’ll also visit Sardi’s to see the famous character portraits, learning about the on and off-screen shenanigans of Broadway’s biggest names. <br><br>With your Broadway Insider guide, you’ll see the most popular cast hangouts and identify the most important theatres — in both a historic sense and from a theatrical and musical standpoint. You’ll hear stories you’ll hardly be able to believe (like how a goat once fell from the roof of one of these very theatres) and get a grasp of just how colossal a Broadway production is; how much blood and sweat goes into every performance and how many people there are behind the scenes and in the wings every time the curtain rises. <br><br>Like a theatre director on opening night, you can rest assured that we’ve taken painstaking care over the little details on this tour. We’ve chosen only the best guides to join our Broadway Insiders team and have drawn up the perfect route to showcase the very best of showbiz, combining the magic of Disney and the glamour of Broadway into one epic behind-the-magic adventure. <br><br>Note: Between January 2017 and July of 2018, the costume and prop access will be restored via a mobile cart brought into the orchestra section of the theatre. <br><br>Sites Visited: <br><br>      New Amsterdam Theatre (including Prop Studio) <br>      Duffy Square<br>      Times Square<br>      Sardi’s<br>      Rodgers & Hammerstein Way<br>      Shubert Alley<br>      Marriott Marquis Theatre (from outside) <br>      Majestic Theatre (from outside) <br>      American Airlines Theatre (from outside) <br><br>Important Notes: <br><br>      Gratuities to guides are appreciated but never obligatory. <br>      Please note that the tour meeting time is 15 minutes prior to the start time. No refunds or re-bookings can be provided for late arrivals or no shows after tour commencement or departure. <br>      Please note, the voucher is NOT redeemable at the New Amsterdam Theater ticket desk. <br>      Due to ongoing construction and preparations of the New Amsterdam Theatre for the premiere of Frozen on Broadway, from November 2016 through January 2017, the costume room access will be replaced by an actual backstage experience. The backstage area of Broadway theatres has been off limits to public tours for decades, and hasn't been accessed by the public in the New Amsterdam in nearly a century.

The memorials here rarely get the attention they deserve, from visitors rushing past to board the ferry. The stories they have to tell are well worth hearing though, so we’ll spare some time for the Castle Clinton National Monument, Pier A Harbor House, the American Merchant Mariner’s Memorial, the Sphere and New York Korean War Veteran’s Memorial. <br><br>Then it’s off to Liberty Island, with priority boarding to get us the best seats on the ferry – and since we leave so early you’ll arrive at the Statue before the crowds. Once there, you’ll enjoy stunning views back over the city and a guided tour that takes you right into the pedestal, getting you closer to Lady Liberty than a regular visit. <br><br>Here your guide will teach you a little about the city’s greatest icon. Gifted to the US by France and designed by their finest architects including Gustav Eiffel (whose Parisian Tower you may be familiar with), Lady Liberty wasn’t as warmly received as you would think. With your expert guide on hand, you’ll hear all about the struggle that got her on her feet and made her even more special to the people of New York. <br><br>Then it’s back on the ferry and on to Ellis Island, where you’ll follow in the footsteps of 12 million immigrants. With your expert guide on hand you’ll learn about the lengthy immigration process they went through, walking the Stairs of Separation to understand the island’s two very different names – ‘The Island of Hope’ and ‘The Island of Tears’. Together you’ll explore the museum’s impressive collection of interactive displays, asking all the questions you want of your expert guide. Our tour ends in Ellis Island, so you can stay a little longer if you’d like, or head back on the ferry with your guide. <br><br>With small groups of 20 people or fewer and early morning ferries to the islands, we ensure that your tour is peaceful and relaxed, removing the stress and frustrations of the average visit. And with an expert guide on hand you’re certain to learn a thing or two, getting more from your experience than you would have on your own. <br><br>Sites Visited: <br><br>Statue of Liberty Museum and Pedestal<br>Ellis Island Museum<br>Castle Clinton National Monument<br>Pier A Harbor House (from exterior) <br>American Merchant Mariner’s Memorial<br>The Sphere<br>New York Korean War Veterans Memorial<br><br>Important Notes: <br><br>Gratuities to guides are appreciated but never obligatory. <br>Please note that the tour meeting time is 15 minutes prior to the start time.

Explore the museum exhibits alone, at your own pace. <br>•Explore the surrounding monuments including the Fireman’s Memorial & the Survivor’s tree. <br>•Led by an expert local guide, you’ll hear personal stories from that fateful day, giving your visit a human context, and with small groups and all tickets purchased in advance, your visit is intimate, relaxed and hassle-free. <br><br>Overview: <br><br>Everyone remembers where they were on September 11, 2001. An event that shook the world, the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center changed the path of recent history in a way we still see every day. Visit Ground Zero to gain a deeper understanding of 9/11, the affect it had on the city (and the world!) and the long struggle undergone in New York City to move forward from that day. <br><br>Description: <br><br>With an expert local guide, you’ll explore not just the 9/11 Memorial & Museum, but the areas and landmarks around the World Trade Center that featured so poignantly in news reports after the attacks. <br><br>At Brookfield Place (previously known as the World Financial Center) you’ll learn about the economic effects of the attack and the struggle to rebuild afterwards. You’ll visit the Eleven Tears Memorial, a touching and personal memorial, which commemorates the 11 American Express employees that died in 9/11. The Winter Garden is another must-see on Vesey Street. You may have missed it on your own, but with a local guide leading the way, you won’t miss a beat. <br><br>After that we’ll head for Ground Zero, to see the stunning 9/11 Memorial Pools, each one built in the footprint of one of the twin towers, and inscribed with the names of all those who perished in the attack. Your guide will take this time to give you a more personal account of the tragedy that unfolded here, taking you to the Fireman’s Memorial and the Survivor Tree to tell you the incredible stories of courage and loss that unfolded right where you stand. <br><br>The last stop on our tour is one we’ll let you manage on your own. The 9/11 Museum is a very well curated space, with artifacts salvaged from the event on display, alongside countless personal stories. It’s a very moving visit, best taken in at your own pace in silence. We still have one last perk though – we’ve pre-reserved your museum tickets, so you’ll skip long lines to gain immediate access. <br><br>We’ve kept our groups small for this tour to ensure a level of intimacy and peace that’s fitting for such a visit, and have chosen only the best local guides to give your tour a more personal feel, giving the 9/11 Memorial and its surrounds a more human context. <br><br>Sites Visited:<br>•St Paul's Chapel<br>•Brookfield Place (formerly known as World Financial Center) <br>•American Express Eleven Tears Memorial<br>•Winter Garden<br>•9/11 Memorial Museum (Museum is non-guided) <br>•9/11 Memorial Pools<br>•Freedom Tower (from exterior) <br>•Fireman's Memorial<br>•Survivor Tree<br>•North Cove Marina<br><br>Important Notes: <br><br>•Gratuities to guides are appreciated but never obligatory. <br>•Please note that the tour meeting time is 15 minutes prior to the start time.
